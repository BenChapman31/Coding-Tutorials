# Coding-Tutorials
Multiple scripts showing the basic features of some programming languages.

There are currently tutorials for:
 - Fortran 90/95
 - MPI Fortran 
 - OpenMP Fortran
 - C++
 - OpenMP C++
 - BASH
 - Python

I will eventually get round to doing tutorials for:
- MPI C++
- CUDA C++
- CUDA Fortran
- Matlab
- other languages if I find a good reason to learn them.

The idea behind these is that the interested student can learn the language by running the program and following the output while looking at the source code to work out what's going on. 

To run some of the tutorials you may need to install the necessary compilers/modules. None of these tutorials are comprehensive, rather they are designed to showcase the basic features of each language. It's possible, even likely, that there are mistakes or inefficiencies I've missed. If you spot any please email me. Forgive any spelling mistakes in the coding comments... I'll correct as I go along. These tutorials are based on a combination of my own experience, and various online tutorials. I have tried to give credit to the latter in the comments of each code.

If you spot any mistakes, or areas which could be expanded upon, please let me know by emailing: bc661@alumni.york.ac.uk

I hope these are useful, let me know how you get on!
